This website is a culmination of our work for HUM331 A History of Words. After exploring the digital humanities in class, we were tasked with creating our own digital humanities project, combining the methods we learned with archival research. As a group, we chose to focus on the history of inclusion - and exclusion - in Princeton's eating clubs.

### More Information

The website was created by Amna Amin, Class of 2021, and Paul-Louis Biondi, Class of 2024. More information about our academic interests and background can be found in our author bios
