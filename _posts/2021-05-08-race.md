title: Race and Eating Clubs

## Racism in Imagery 

The Princeton Bric-A-Brac refers to the yearbook that students used to put our every year. Within these year books, students would list the names of members of different organizations and also display drawings meant to show the character of the club. 

Eating club imagery was often included in these yearbooks. Unfortunately, some of this imagery would display racist caricatures. For example, the following two images used for eating clubs display caricatures of Asians and Native Americans in the 1890s.

At this point in Princeton's history there were little to no Native Americans or Asians around campus. However, these images were still used. This situation demonstrates the racist attitudes held by members of eating clubs. 

The stereotypes they seem to enjoy are particularly concerning given that they did not interact with people of color that they were using as caricatures. This early history demonstrates that from the start eating clubs were not set up to be racially inclusive. 

In addition to these caricatures, there are several yearbook images from the 1890s that show black people only as servers. This trend of black people being seen almost exclusively as workers is something that continued to plague eating clubs later on. 
For instance, in his oral history about his time at Princeton, Alfred Price (Class of 1969) discusses how black students on financial aid were often workers at the eating clubs their white peers were members of.

## Not Wanting to Engage and Issues with Bicker 

As Princeton's student population became more diverse, it may seem initially surprising that eating clubs often did not reflect this diversity. 

However, students of color often describe feeling odd in the environment of eating clubs or having a harder time in the bicker process. 

For example, in a 2009 article entitled Race and The Street in the Daily Princetonian, Abiodun Azeez, a black student on campus explained that "
The dining halls are definitely more diverse [than the clubs], the eating clubs are largely comprised of upper/upper-middle class white students, and so I think that it’s catered to what they as the majority want.” As a result, she was not going to join an eating club. 

Another black student named Trent Arthur discusses how he has enjoyed his stime as a member of Tower Club, but he is also noted that black students were at a disadvantage in bicker since there were not people in the clubs who looked like them and would help them to join. 

The article also notes that bicker clubs at the time were less diverse than their sign-in peers. This situation makes sense since bicker is a selective process in which people tend to pick others like them or people already in their social circles which can be segregated. 

A 2010 report from the university recommended that eating clubs work to have more initiatives that reach out to students of color so they feel welcome in the clubs and try to bicker.
